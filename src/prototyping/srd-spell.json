The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.</p>\r\n      <p>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal</i>,  <i>dominate person</i>,  or <i>dominate monster</i>,  your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a <i>binding</i> spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.</p>\r\n      <p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p>\r\n      <p>If you are casting any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature succeeds on this save, all the <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.</p>\r\n      <p>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Chaining:</i> The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>Antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is one year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Slumber:</i> This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while <i>slumbering</i>, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is more difficult to cast than <i>chaining</i>, making it slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Bound Slumber:</i> This combination of <i>chaining</i> and <i>slumber</i> lasts for as long as one month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Hedged Prison:</i> The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. The effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Metamorphosis:</i> The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>metamorphosed</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Minimus Containment:</i> The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while <i>contained</i>, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p>\r\n      <p>You can't dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>Mage's disjunction</i> affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to <i>dismissal</i>,  <i>banishment</i>,  or a similar effect.</p>\r\n      <p>In addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of <i>binding</i> (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.</p>\r\n      <p/>\r\n<p>The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell.</p>",

This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own <i>crown of vermin</i>. The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>crown of vermin</i> bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermin</i>. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren't enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell's effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.</p>\n      <p>The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell's duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the character's control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character's base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character's spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A character can see through his or her <i>crown of vermin</i> without difficulty, but gains one-half concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and within the character's <i>crown of vermin</i>.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.</p>\n      <p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:</p>\n      <p><i>Targeted Dispel:</i> One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.</p>\n      <p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p>\n      <p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level. If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a <i>bag of holding</i>) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p>\n      <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p>\n      <p><i>Area Dispel:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.</p>\n      <p>For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the <i>dispel magic</i> spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's magic items are not affected.</p>\n      <p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>\n      <p>For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.</p>\n      <p>For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>\n      <p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>monster summoning</i>) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.</p>\n      <p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p>\n      <p><i>Counterspell:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast.

The specific effect of an <i>earthquake</i> spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.</p>\n      <p><i>Cave</i>,  <i>Cavern</i>,  <i>or Tunnel:</i> The spell collapses the roof, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake</i> cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.</p>\n      <p><i>Cliffs: Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p>\n      <p><i>Open Ground:</i> Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut, killing any creatures still trapped within.</p>\n      <p><i>Structure:</i> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p>\n      <p><i>River</i>,  <i>Lake</i>,  <i>or Marsh:</i> Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p>\n      <p><i>Pinned beneath Rubble:</i> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

No matter how many negative levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative levels into account).

The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon's Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and probably can't cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the <i>eidolon</i> spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character's soul, so it is the character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her <i>eidolon</i> communicate with each other normally.

      "description": "\n      <p>Casting a <i>gate</i> spell has two effects. First, it creates an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel between those two planes in either direction.</p>\n      <p>Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the <i>gate</i>.</p>\n      <p>The <i>gate</i> itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice), oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.</p>\n      <p>A <i>gate</i> has a front and a back. Creatures moving through the <i>gate</i> from the front are transported to the other plane; creatures moving through it from the back are not.</p>\n      <p><i>Planar Travel:</i> As a mode of planar travel, a <i>gate</i> spell functions much like a <i>plane shift</i> spell, except that the <i>gate</i> opens precisely at the point you desire (a creation effect). Deities and other beings who rule a planar realm can prevent a <i>gate</i> from opening in their presence or personal demesnes if they so desire. Travelers need not join hands with you-anyone who chooses to step through the portal is transported. A <i>gate</i> cannot be opened to another point on the same plane; the spell works only for interplanar travel.</p>\n      <p>You may hold the <i>gate</i> open only for a brief time (no more than 1 round per caster level), and you must concentrate on doing so, or else the interplanar connection is severed.</p>\n      <p><i>Calling Creatures:</i> The second effect of the <i>gate</i> spell is to call an extraplanar creature to your aid (a calling effect). By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate</i>,  although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has an XP cost (see below).</p>\n      <p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual you may call either a single creature (of any HD) or several creatures. You can call and control several creatures as long as their HD total does not exceed your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD do not exceed twice your caster level. A single creature with more HD than twice your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p>\n      <p>A controlled creature can be commanded to perform a service for you. Such services fall into two categories: immediate tasks and contractual service. Fighting for you in a single battle or taking any other actions that can be accomplished within 1 round per caster level counts as an immediate task; you need not make any agreement or pay any reward for the creature's help. The creature departs at the end of the spell.</p>\n      <p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. (Some creatures may want their payment in 'livestock' rather than in coin, which could involve complications.) Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.</p>\n      <p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate</i> to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The hand then beckons to that creature and leads it to you if the creature is willing to follow.</p>\n      <p>When the spell is cast, the hand appears in front of you. You then specify a person (or any creature) by physical description, which can include race, gender, and appearance but not ambiguous factors such as level, alignment, or class. When the description is complete, the hand streaks off in search of a subject that fits the description. The amount of time it takes to find the subject depends on how far away she is.</p>\n      <table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td><b>Distance</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Time to Locate</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>100 ft. or less<br/></td>\n<td>1 round<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>1,000 ft.<br/></td>\n<td>1 minute<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>1 mile<br/></td>\n<td>10 minutes<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>2 miles<br/></td>\n<td>1 hour<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>3 miles<br/></td>\n<td>2 hours<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>4 miles<br/></td>\n<td>3 hours<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='3' curcol='3'>\n<td>5 miles<br/></td>\n<td>4 hours<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table>\n      <p>Once the hand locates the subject, it beckons the creature to follow it. If the subject does so, the hand points in your direction, indicating the most direct feasible route. The hand hovers 10 feet in front of the subject, moving before it at a speed of as much as 240 feet per round. Once the hand leads the subject back to you, it disappears.</p>\n      <p>The subject is not compelled to follow the hand or act in any particular way toward you. If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.</p>\n      <p>If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.</p>\n      <p>If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.</p>\n      <p>The ghostly hand has no physical form. It is invisible to anyone except you and a potential subject. It cannot engage in combat or execute any other task aside from locating a subject and leading it back to you. The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

When the character casts the spell, a stroke of energy deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to each creature within the spell's area. <i>Living lightning</i> follows all the standard rules for epic spell casting when the character casts it. <i>Living lightning</i> is sentient and generally friendly toward the character. It has the character's mental ability scores, but it has no physical ability scores. It senses the world through the character's senses and communicates with him or her by thought. As a self-triggering spell, it isn't truly alive but is a fragment of the character's personality. It cares little for the world around it, but at the character's urging (and sometimes at its own discretion) it casts itself at his or her foes. Casters who prepare spells before casting must prepare <i>Living lightning</i> normally in order for it to cast itself. When the spell casts itself, it acts on the character's initiative but does not count against his or her own actions in the round. The character cannot simultaneously cast <i>Living lightning</i> while it is casting its own effect, even if it has been prepared more than once. <i>Living lightning</i> uses up one of the character's epic spell slots for the day whenever it casts itself. When the character has used up all his or her epic spell slots for the day (or has cast all his or her prepared <i>Living lightning</i> spells, if a caster who must prepare spells), <i>Living lightning</i> becomes quiescent.

You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.</p>\n      <p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding</i>,  <i>planar binding</i>,  and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p>\n      <p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection</i>,  <i>blink</i>,  <i>dimension door</i>,  <i>etherealness</i>,  <i>gate</i>,  <i>plane shift</i>,  <i>shadow walk</i>,  <i>teleport</i>,  and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>,  but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p>\n      <p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p>\n      <p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p>\n      <p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar</i>. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty.</p>\n      <p>To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.</p>\n      <p>While in the <i>magic jar</i>,  you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more Hit Dice between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)</p>\n      <p>You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.</p>\n      <p>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar</i>,  and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.</p>\n      <p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar</i>. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.</p>\n      <p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.</p>\n      <p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar</i>,  if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p>\n      <p>If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar</i>,  you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar</i> or at the host's location.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

      "description": "\n      <p>Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.</p>\n      <p>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.</p>\n      <p>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.</p>\n      <p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can escape or attack you.</p>\n      <p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p>\n      <p>When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the <i>protection from evil</i> effect. If the <i>protection from evil</i> effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.</p>\n      <p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1. If the subject was 1st level, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2.

To imbue another creature with the ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or when a particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible if not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.</p>\n      <p>The caster can also use the <i>energy</i> seed to create a spell that carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using the <i>energy</i> seed this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster can't directly target a creature or object, though indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards-even a tornado that moves randomly in the affected area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an additional use of the <i>energy</i> seed.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

If slain or destroyed, the transformed creature or object reverts to its original form. The subject's equipment, if any, remains untransformed or melds into the new form's body, at the caster's option. The transformed creature or object acquires the physical and natural abilities of the creature or object it has been changed into while retaining its own memories and mental ability scores. Mental abilities include personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, base saves, extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural abilities. Physical abilities include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons, and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth), and possibly hardness. Creatures transformed into inanimate objects do not gain the benefit of their untransformed physical abilities, and may well be blind, deaf, dumb, and unfeeling. Objects transformed into creatures gain that creature's average physical ability scores, but are considered to have mental ability scores of 0 (the <i>fortify</i> seed can add points to each mental ability, if desired). For each normal extraordinary ability or supernatural ability granted to the transformed creature, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. The transformed subject can have no more Hit Dice than the caster has or than the subject has (whichever is greater). In any case, for each Hit Die the assumed form has above 15, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The base use of the <i>Transport</i> seed provides instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. To shift the transportation medium to another medium increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster does not need to make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to him or her. Only objects worn or carried (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. For a spell intended to transport unwilling creatures, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4.

If the caster attempts to use the <i>Transport</i> seed with insufficient or misleading information, the character disappears and simply reappear in his or her original location.</p>\n      <p>As a special use of the <i>Transport</i> seed, a caster can develop a spell that temporarily transports him or her into a different time stream (leaving the caster in the same physical location); this increases the Spellcraft DC by +8. If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject, into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed-no force or effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More simply, the seed can <i>haste</i> or <i>slow</i> a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the Spellcraft DC by -4.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The caster can protect a creature or area from magic. Alternatively, he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a specified area. A ward against standard damage protects a creature from whichever two the caster selects of the three damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created with the <i>Ward</i> seed absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of the damage is natural or magical. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.</p>\n      <p>A ward against energy grants a creature protection from whichever one the caster selects of the five energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified energy type, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or magical. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well. For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1.</p>\n      <p>A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily contact from whichever one of several monster types the caster selects. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or intentionally moves within 5 feet of the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p>\n      <p>A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell. Epic spells using the <i>Dispel</i> seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted epic spell using the <i>Destroy</i> seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check.</p>\n      <p>Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the <i>Ward</i> seed to nullify all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a ward that nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells).

Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.</p>\n      <p>Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p>\n      <p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p>\n      <p>A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p>\n      <p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>\n      <p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon.

A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time.

      "description": "\n      <p>This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a <i>symbol of death</i> slays one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The <i>symbol of death</i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. Any creature that enters the area while the <i>symbol of death</i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.</p>\n      <p>Until it is triggered, the <i>symbol of death</i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i>symbol of death</i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i>symbol of death</i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i>symbol of death</i> works normally.</p>\n      <p>As a default, a <i>symbol of death</i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i>symbol of death</i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p>\n      <p>In this case, 'reading' the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i>symbol of death</i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a <i>symbol of death</i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i>symbol of death</i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p>\n      <p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i>symbol of death</i> can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don't qualify.</p>\n      <p>When scribing a <i>symbol of death</i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p>\n      <p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of death</i>,  but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes proportionately longer. Any creature attuned to a <i>symbol of death</i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbols of death</i>, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p>\n      <p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol of death</i> with a DC 19 Spellcraft check. Of course, if the <i>symbol of death</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.</p>\n      <p>A <i>symbol of death</i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of death</i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i>symbol of death</i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.</p>\n      <p><i>symbol of death</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>symbol of death</i> that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.</p>\n      <p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>symbol of death</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a <i>symbol of death</i> and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for <i>symbol of death</i>.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p>\n      <p><i>Sustained Force:</i> A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p>\n      <p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p>\n      <p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.</p>\n      <p><i>Combat Maneuver:</i> Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p>\n      <p><i>Violent Thrust:</i> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p>\n      <p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects).</p>\n      <p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</p>\n      <p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>\n      <p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p>\n      <p><i>Familiarity:</i> 'Very familiar' is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. 'Studied carefully' is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you've been there often, or you have used other means (such as <i>scrying</i>) to study the place for at least one hour. 'Seen casually' is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. 'Viewed once' is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.</p>\n      <p>'False destination' is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p>\n      <p><i>On Target:</i> You appear where you want to be.</p>\n      <p><i>Off Target:</i> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</p>\n      <p><i>Similar Area:</i> You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.</p>\n      <p>Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>\n      <p><i>Mishap:</i> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten 'scrambled.' You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time 'Mishap' comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.</p>\n      <table width='100%' border='1' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' frame='VOID' rules='ROWS'>\n\n<tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'>\n<td><b>Familiarity</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>On Target</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Off Target</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Similar Area</b><br/></td>\n<td><b>Mishap</b><br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'>\n<td>Very familiar<br/></td>\n<td>01-97<br/></td>\n<td>98-99<br/></td>\n<td>100<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'>\n<td>Studied carefully<br/></td>\n<td>01-94<br/></td>\n<td>95-97<br/></td>\n<td>98-99<br/></td>\n<td>100<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'>\n<td>Seen casually<br/></td>\n<td>01-88<br/></td>\n<td>89-94<br/></td>\n<td>95-98<br/></td>\n<td>99-100<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'>\n<td>Viewed once<br/></td>\n<td>01-76<br/></td>\n<td>77-88<br/></td>\n<td>89-96<br/></td>\n<td>97-100<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr maxcol='6' curcol='6'>\n<td>False destination (1d20+80)<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n<td>-<br/></td>\n<td>81-92<br/></td>\n<td>93-100<br/></td>\n\n</tr>\n</table>\n      <p/>\n    ",

The character's future self is technically only a possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future self are both free to act normally this round (the character has already used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn't). The future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or she finishes casting <i>time duplicate</i>. Because the future self was previously only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies this round). Likewise, he or she doesn't have any special knowledge of what might occur during this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter's future duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn't there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.</p>\n      <p><i>Round One:</i> The character casts <i>time duplicate</i>, the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally.</p>\n      <p><i>Round Two:</i> The future self-the character-gets snatched back in time to help the past self.

Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of <i>time duplicate</i> are not possible.

It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.</p>\n      <p>The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

A <i>wall of ice</i> cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice</i>,  and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice</i> creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.</p>\n      <p><i>Ice Plane:</i> A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.</p>\n      <p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.</p>\n      <p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).</p>\n      <p><i>Hemisphere:</i> The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The <i>hemisphere</i> is as hard to break through as the <i>ice plane</i> form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",

Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.</p>\n      <p/>\n    ",
